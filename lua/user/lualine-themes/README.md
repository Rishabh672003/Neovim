## Different lualine themes and how to apply them

### lualine1
This is the default theme and it works out of the box without doing any changes

### lualine2
this is a theme i found on internet and the credit goes to ![Navepnow](https://github.com/NavePnow/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/lualine.lua) it looks very nice. but to use this you will need the nvim-gps plugin, its already in the plugins.lua so you have to just go and uncomment it (line 88-91)
