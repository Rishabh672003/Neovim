After launching neovim for the first time, packer will automatically install all the extension and will give you some errors, just ignore them and reopen neovim the errors should be resolved.

### Credit

the credit goes to [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) and its author who made this awesome repo and video playlist, this is from where i learned how to make and structure the configs and actually make it work, i used his configs as a base for most of the plugins and modified them for my needs.
also i took configs and ideas from [Lunarvim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim) and [Astronvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)
