# Neovim

This repo contains all my [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configs files, which I use. Now made with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
Now this doesn't uses Mason, so you would have to install all lsp yourself.

### üõ†Ô∏è If you also want to use it

#### It only works with nvim-nightly

#### Neovim-nightly as an appimage

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/nightly/nvim.appimage && sudo chmod +x nvim.appimage
```

#### Steps to build neovim

```bash
#build dependencies
sudo pacman -Sy --needed --noconfirm git base-devel cmake unzip ninja tree-sitter curl
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim && cd neovim && make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo && sudo make install
```

#### Make a backup of your current nvim folder

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvimbackup
```

#### Clone the repository and open nvim

For main branch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishabh672003/Neovim ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```

## optional dependencies

These are all the optional dependencies if you dont want anything just remove them neovim should work fine either way

#### LSP dependencies as now these configs dont use mason, so you will have to install them yourself

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy --needed --noconfirm lua-language-server rust-analyzer;
yay -S jdtls lemminx;
cargo install --features lsp --locked taplo-cli;
cargo install prosemd-lsp;
sudo npm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted;
```

For null-ls to work for formatting and stuff

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed --noconfirm stylua prettier astyle zsh autopep8 ; yay -S beautysh shellcheck-bin
```

Other dependencies

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed --noconfirm ripgrep npm unzip
```

## Automatting the whole process of building neovim from source and applying the config

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rishabh672003/Neovim/main/install.sh)
```

### Credit

The credit goes to [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) and its author [Christian](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli) who made this awesome repo and video playlist, this is from where I learned how to make and structure the configs and actually made it work, I used his configs as a base for most of the plugins and modified them for my needs.
also I took configs and ideas from [Lunarvim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim), [Astronvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim), [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) and [nvim-basic-ide](https://github.com/lunarvim/nvim-basic-ide)
